        <p>Brimstone is a powerful commander that utilizes incendiary grenades, smokescreen airstrikes, and rapid-fire-inducing stim beacons to damage enemies and buff teammates. His impressive Orbital Strike ultimate summons an enormous laser that destroys anyone who doesn't move out of the radius fast enough.</p>

        <p>Hailing from the U.K., Phoenix's star power shines through in his fighting style, igniting the battlefield with flash and flare. Whether he's got backup or not, he'll rush into a fight on his own terms.</p>
        <p>The fiery Brit can wield the power of flame to essentially reshape the battlefield into how he sees fit. With exploding fireballs that damage enemies and heal him, a vision-blocking wall of fire, and a blinding fire burst, Phoenix is great at manipulating the flow of the match. His ultimate grants him the ability to be reborn if he's killed during its duration, galvanizing him to make bold moves he wouldn't otherwise make.</p>
